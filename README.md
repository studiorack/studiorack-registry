# studiorack-registry has been deprecated

StudioRack registry was a prototype of an open-source audio plugin registry. It showed what was possible by publishing plugin metadata and making it available to command line tools, apps and websites.

This registry required maintenance to keep up-to-date and was missing important features such as:
- Support for projects/presets
- Target specific operating systems and architectures
- File hashes for security
- Multiple plugin/archive formats

We have now combined forces with the Owlplug team, to define an open-source shared audio package registry specification and GitHub organization. The new registry supports those important features and will allow the registry to scale beyond StudioRack and Owlplug to other audio package managers.
